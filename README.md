# observability and compliance across all Azure resources

## Current Challenges

* Inconsistent monitoring
* Each team manually enable azure monitor leading in gaps of logs and metrics
* Observability is not centralised
* Logs are spread across subscriptions and not retained uniformly
* Weak governance
* Naming standards not enforced
* Log retention varies by team
* Low scalability
* Onboarding new applications requires manual effort and rework
* Diagnostic settings optional
